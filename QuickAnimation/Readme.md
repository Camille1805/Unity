# Quick animation scripts 

1. Use UnityArmature.py to generate an armature consistent with futher steps
1. Use FcurvesOperator.py to save or load animations. 
1. If you add new bones to the structure: make sure their name starts with `other_` and be aware that they will not be recorded in the animation
