# Quick animation scripts 

1. Use UnityArmature.py to generate an armature consistent with futher steps
1. Use FcurvesOperator.py to save or load animations. 
1. If you add new bones to the structure: make sure their name starts with `other_` and be aware that they will not be recorded in the animation


# New version ! 
Several improvements have been made: 
* No need to insert keyframes for all the bones 
* No restriction on names. Whichever name you used to record the animation will be used as reference for loading it.
* Has a small tentative to conserve proportions via a ratio
