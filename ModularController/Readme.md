# Best controller so far

While still in 2D, just a few things would need to evolve in order to upgrade to 3D. 

Good thing is that the controller in now modular: 

* ModularController ties it all
* MoveModule for Run, Dash (jump to come) 
* FightController + HitImpact for fighting purposes

Also, recently discovered StateBehaviours, which is such a great thing ! 
This controller relies hence also on a few scripts derived from StateMachineBehaviours
