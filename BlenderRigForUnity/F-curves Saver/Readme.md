# F-Curve saver
This new version allows support for bones that are not part of BasicHuma. 

Major point of interest: include weapons for instance, tails or whatever. 
Two restrictions: 
* Make sure to name your external bones by beginning by "other" otherwise, scripts will break. Example: other_sword, otherGun, other_Tail1... 
* The script does not record the curves for the weapons, only the body is taken into account. However, this still is interesting.
