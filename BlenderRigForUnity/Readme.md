# Blender Procedural Animation

# I. Rig

Using `ArmatureUnity.py` will create a rig with IK constraint ready for Unity Mecanim. 
Script could be optimized, but works okay for now 

# II. Animation

Efforts have been put into a script that can generate automatic animations. Here's how it works: 

* The script creates a class based on the armature generated by `ArmatureUnity.py`
* It can load an initial pose, which is the T-pose, or create a new one 
* Methods are being designed to create keyframes of animation, theoretically usable over many different sized rigs because description of the movement is based on arms and legs length

### To record more animation:

Create your animation as usual, using keyframes. Then, for each step, use the `print_pose` method to get a log on the console with what you should copy in a new method



# To do: 
* Think of a better way to structure the code. One idea would be to record movements in pickable objects rather than writing them in code 
* Is it possible to use the F-curves ?
